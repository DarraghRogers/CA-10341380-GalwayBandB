				<h1>Testimonials form some of our past residents</h1>
					<h3 >A great place to stay</h3>
						<p>
						"My wife and I stayed two nights here
						and had the ensuite room on the top floor with 
						use of a lounge and kitchen but as we were the 
						only guests we had the whole apartment to ourselves.
						The location is ideal right in 
						the middle of town with a good view of the local
						streets."
						</p>
					<h3>A home away from home</h3>
						<p>
						we spent 5 nights at Gannon's during the 
						Arts festival and simply couldn't imagine a
						better arrangement for us. We shared the upper 
						quarters (two guest rooms and shared kitchen/living 
						areas) with friends of ours so it felt like a 
						private apartment. We had everything we 
						needed provided--coffee, tea, snacks, breakfast
						fixings--and if we wanted to stock up on anything
						else, the grocery store was directly across the 
						street. We didnt have daily maid service, but we 
						werent expecting it, so that's just an FYI for 
						others. Two flights of stairs to get to our unit 
						meant plenty of privacy. Gerry was super friendly 
						and accomodating, but not in your face.

						Stayed September 2014, travelled with friends
						</p>
					<h3>Really lovely B and B and super host</h3>
						<p>
							We booked for two nights and stayed three.
							Great location in Cliften and Gerry runs a
							very good B&B. The rooms are beautifully
							furnished and the common areas very 
							comfortable with big soft sofas. The 
							breakfast is continental and a nice change
							from the Irish cooked breakfast, which we 
							also enjoy. We can recommend the scones 
							too - very tasty and served hot from the
							oven. No complaints and would return again.

							Stayed September 2014, travelled as a couple
